## Description

**StockFlow_API** is a RESTful API developed in Python for **inventory management with blockchain-enhanced security**.  
Each transaction (inbound or outbound) generates a **unique cryptographic hash** that is **timestamped with an immutable marker** using **OpenTimestamps** and later anchored in the **Bitcoin blockchain**.

The system offers:
- Full product CRUD
- Inventory movement operations with integrity control
- Transaction verification and proof download (.ots)

> Target audience: developers, integrators, and teams that need an **auditable** inventory control system with **data integrity assurance**.

## How does blockchain protection work?

Each inventory movement generates:
1. A **SHA-256 hash** with the transaction data
2. A `.ots` file (OpenTimestamps), which records this hash with a timestamp
3. This `.ots` is submitted to **public calendars**, which later **anchor the timestamp in the Bitcoin blockchain**

With this, it is possible to:
- Prove that the transaction occurred at a certain moment
- Ensure that the data **was never tampered with**
- Verify and audit any transaction, locally or remotely

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to configure the database connection, API security, and the path to save .ots proof files.

A template .env.example file is included in the repository to make initial setup and configuration easier. Just copy and rename it to .env.

---

## Manual Setup (without Docker)
> Follow the steps below to run the StockFlow_API application in your local environment:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduzin3983/StockFlow_API.git
```
```bash
cd StockFlow_API/
```

### 2. Install uv
> Skip this step if you already have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # On Linux/Mac
```
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"   # On Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
> `uv sync` creates the `.venv`, installs the exact versions from `uv.lock`, and downloads Python 3.14 if needed.
```bash
uv sync
```

### 4. Configure environment variables
> Copy the example file and edit it according to your environment.

### 5. Initialize the database
> `uv run` executes the command inside the project environment, so there is no venv to activate.
```bash
uv run flask db upgrade
```

### 6. Run the application
```bash
uv run flask run
```
> The API will be available at: http://localhost:5001

## Running with Docker
> The project includes a complete Docker environment for quick and reproducible setup. This includes the Flask API and a PostgreSQL container with volume persistence.

### 1. Create a `.env` file from the example
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. (Optional) Adjust default admin credentials
Inside .env, change the values:
```env
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@email.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
```
> These will be used to create the first admin user automatically when the container runs.

### 3. Run the full stack with Docker Compose
```env
docker compose up --build
```
### 4. Finished!
> The API will be available at: http://localhost:5001

### Stopping and cleaning Docker!
```bash
docker compose down
```
> This will stop the containers but preserve the data stored in the volume pgdata.

If you want to remove the volume too:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Initial Access and Creation of the First User

For **security** reasons, the system **does not have a public user registration endpoint**.  
The creation of new users must be done **exclusively by authenticated administrators**.

### How to create the first user?

Since there is no pre-registered administrator, the first user **must be inserted manually into the database** via SQL.

To do this, generate an encrypted `password_hash` using the script included in the project:

#### Script: `generate_password.py`

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.generate_password
```
> Enter the desired password (e.g.: admin123) and copy the generated hash.

Then, execute the command below in your PostgreSQL database (adjust the fields as necessary):

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password_hash, permission, create_at)
VALUES (
  'Admin',
  'admin@email.com',
  'PASSWORD_HASH', -- BCRYPT HASH
  'admin',
  CURRENT_DATE
);
```

### User flow security
- There is no public registration (signup) available in the API

- Only authenticated administrators can register, edit, and remove users

- This ensures complete control over access and prevents the creation of unauthorized accounts

### After manually registering the first admin, you will be able to:

- Log in using the /api/login endpoint

- Use the returned JWT token to access protected endpoints

- Create other users using the /api/users/create endpoint

## Postman

You can test all API endpoints directly with the resources below:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.postman.com/edu3983/stockflow-api/overview)   
Access the complete collection directly in Postman Web

[Postman Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29521779/2sB2qWJ557)  
View examples, schemas, and detailed descriptions of the endpoints

After login, the JWT token is automatically saved as the `token` variable and used in all authenticated requests.
